# Market-Billing-System
## Simple billing system using JOptionPane on JAVA
### By creating an Inventory class, I can instantiate multiple object each with a price and a quantity. 
### The user makes a selection of items through JOptionPane as the GUI. 
### Each button on the GUI triggers a nested if statement to proceed with the purchase. 
### The user then views their final receipt with a summary of their purchase.
